Task Manager :
The student chooses the task-manager bot to ask/look at his/her task assigned for the day. The next day, the student has to tell if he/she has completed the task. If no, then they have to state the valid reason. If yes, he/she gets another task. She/he can also enter doubts in the bot or have an appointment fixed with the concerned teacher.

For the questions and options database is used and flask is used where the student gets their questions and for other web pages, HTML5 and CSS are used.

Teacher bot

It plays an instrumental role by eliminating the repetitive task done by the teacher to answer the same set of questions and also help students to retrieve when they want.

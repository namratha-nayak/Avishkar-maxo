Task Manager :
The student chooses the task-manager bot to ask/look at his/her task assigned for the day. The next day, the student has to tell if he/she has completed the task. If no, then they have to state the valid reason. If yes, he/she gets another task. She/he can also enter doubts in the bot or have an appointment fixed with the concerned teacher.


Practice Questions :
When the student enters it he would have the subject names and can choose within the chapters they need to test themselves on and can work with each of practice questions. For the questions and options database is used and flask is used where the student gets their questions and for other web pages, HTML5 and CSS are used.

Teacher bot
Teacher bot is a chatbot built using the chatterbot python library. It is trained to answer the questions of students regarding their examinations, portions, syllabus, and some more issues. The student needs to just type in their query and the Teacher bot responds to it according to the data fed.  It plays an instrumental role by eliminating the repetitive task done by the teacher to answer the same set of questions and also help students to retrieve when they want.


Aptitude
When a student chooses the word search button it directs to a page where there are different themes, in which a student can choose anyone of those and can play the game by clicking and dragging them and If they did not find the solution, they can click the button called Release the score answer. If the student chooses the Aptitude quiz button it directs to the page where they can test the knowledge on a particular subject and finally can see the score. If the student chooses the quiz button it directs to the page where they can find practice social science quiz questions.

Note Taker
When a student chooses Note taker from the main page it directs to a page with the subjects displayed with subject wise chapter option. When he/she chooses particularly for e.g.  If a student chooses maths, chapter1 option, then it's directed to that respective page with the editor and this is common to all pages i.e. for all subjects. Students can save the notes there itself.
